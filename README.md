Create a program to scrape data from amazon dynamically.

User will enter brand name as a input and also provide specific page numbers they want to scrape.

I user selenium and python to commplete this application.

You guys can use this code and i hope this will help you to understand the concept of selenium and scraping.

This code is static and for dynamic please check my Dynamic_Amazon_Webscraping_With_User-Input repository.
